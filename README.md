**Mod 1 - (Game Project) TO DO**:
1. Set up repo in Github
2. Write README.MD
3. Pseudo Code/ notes
4. Set up code environment
5. Code and pseudo code black jack game + daily commits/update
    - HTML - must use divs for gameplay area
    - CSS - must use flex-box
    - JS - must use functions
**Tic-Tac-Toe:**
 - 2 player black jack (dealer vs player)

**JS**:

 - Game flow (score/blackjack count)
**Code Building Steps**
 1. Create HTML structure for game using button tags, classes, divs and img tags.
 2. Create CSS to stay any objects in HTML structure.
 3. Create JavaScript logic for gameplay:
 4. First we must declare global variables for:
    - Dealer card sum       - Face down card
    - Player card sum       - Card deck
    - Dealer ace count
    - Player ace count
    - "Hit" boolean -> action which allows player to draw.
 5. On page load figure a way to build/shuffle deck for gameplay start.
 6. Create a loop or function to wrap gameplay.
 7. Must declare value of deck -> Array or variable declaration?
 8. When naming cards in JS logic (array or declaration), must match value('') of card with card name in image file (HTML index).
 9. Use a loop to cycle through card options for game load and deck shuffling -> (for-loop or while-loop?).
 10. For deck shuffle, must get random card output for playerand dealer hands -> Math.random()?

**REMEMEMBER**
 Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):
Recommended Features
- A way to reset the board and play again
- CSS to give your game a personal and fun style
- Responsive mobile design
- Work with your instructor to determine additional stretch goals
 If you build a you Game must have:
1. Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player)
- Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer - Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns
2. A win state - a way for the player to win the game High score can be considered a win state
3. A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game
Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays le"
4. A way to keep playing if the game is not over
5. Mul#ple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should con!nue or the overall game is won or lost
- Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer
- the player's hand can either win, lose or !e the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll
- Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (ver!cally or horizontally)
- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
